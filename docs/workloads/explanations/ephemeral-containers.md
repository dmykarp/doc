# Ephemeral containers

Ephemeral container is a temporary container that can be added to an existing pod to perform a specific task, such as debugging, monitoring, or troubleshooting.
Unlike regular containers, ephemeral containers do not persist beyond their immediate use, and they are not part of the podâ€™s desired state.
Therefore, ephemeral containers can be used for debugging and monitoring when a pod is live in a cluster, without changing the pod spec or restarting its pod.
Ephemeral container is useful when `kubectl exec` is insufficient because a container has crashed or a container image doesn't include debugging utilities.

`kubectl debug` can be used as an additional [debug tool](../how-to/debugging.md#kubectl-debug) for running pods alongside `kubectl describe` and to some extent `kubectl logs` and `kubectl exec`
Unlike `exec` and `logs`, `debug` can also be used when your pod is in crashLoopBackOff or for some other reason dont start.
