# Vulnerability reference

SLSA enabler tools in the NAIS ecosystem and faq for vulnerabilities.

## Slsa-verde

Slsa-verde implements software supply chain security measures for container-based workloads.
It monitors workloads in Kubernetes to verify that an image was built by a specific build system or continuous integration (CI) pipeline 
and updates Dependency-track with the current image state.

## Dependency-track

Dependency-track is a Component Analysis platform that allows you to identify and reduce risk in the software supply chain.
Dependency-track operates as a single instance that manages all clusters and stores both attestations and vulnerabilities for all signed attestations successfully deployed.  
<https://dependencytrack.org/>

## Project exists in Dependency-Track, but I can't see the SBOM or vulnerabilities

This issue likely arises from using the GitHub dependency graph resolution output JSON as an input for byosbom. 
This JSON format is incompatible with Dependency-track. 
Please use the SBOM generated by the nais/docker-build-push action instead.

To fix this, remove the similar input from your workflow:

```yaml
    byosbom: dependency-graph-reports/your-file.json
```
